    <string name="pain_management_protocol">
        The goal is to reduce the level of pain for the patient in the pre-hospital setting.
        All patients presenting with pain should be assessed according to the “Wong Pain Scale”
        or the 1-to-10 pain scale. Reassessment should be timed according to medication onset of
        action, changes in patient condition, patient positioning, and other treatments. \n\n

        <b>B.	BASIC CARE</b>
        Basic initial medical care is predicated upon the circumstances causing the pain.
        Determine the underlying cause and direct your initial medical care towards that
        underlying circumstance. Permit no activity. Place patient in position of comfort.
        For cardiac patients, follow the ACS Clinical Care Guideline. For trauma patients
        follow the appropriate trauma care guideline. \n\n
            \t <b>1. Oxygen:</b> Place the patient on oxygen at a rate and manner that helps to reduce
                anxiety and limit the pain. \n
            \t <b>2.	IV:</b> Initiate an IV. If patient’s blood pressure is &lt; 90 mm Hg, administer
                a bolus of up to 500 ml NS. Evaluate/auscultate lungs throughout administration
                of fluid. \n
            \t <b>3.	Capnography:</b> Apply capnography and monitor respiratory drive. \n\n
        <b>C.	ADVANCED CARE</b>  \n\n
            \t 1.	If indicated by pain level, administer medication as described below.
                Throughout administration of pain medication, systolic BP should be maintained at
                &gt; 90 mm Hg. \n
                \t\t <b>i.	Fentanyl</b> 1 mcg/kg IVP. If pain persists, after five minutes repeat dose

        <b>II.	 General Procedure</b> \n\n
            \t •	This is not a one-person procedure. Assistance should be utilized to facilitate the
            best possible patient care. For trauma patients, use a second crewmember to maintain in-line
            C-spine at all times \n\n
            \t •	Basic Life Support procedures should always occur concurrently with the initial assessment
            of any patient with the potential of hypoxia. These should include oxygen (NRB or BVM), manual
            jaw thrust, use of nasal and oral airways, adequate suctioning, etc. For those patients requiring
            BVM ventilation, an adequate seal, along with Sellick\'s Maneuver, is imperative to provide adequate
            ventilation and reduce the occurrence of gastric distention. \n\n
            \t •	Always pre-oxygenate for a minimum of 1 full minute with 100\%% oxygen, being careful not to
            hyperventilate at an excessive rate or force. \n\n
            \t •	If the patient is NOT spontaneously breathing or is breathing ineffectively, provide

                for sedation. If BP &lt; 100 mmHg systolic, skip Midazolam and proceed to Etomidate. \n\n
                \t\t 4.	Wait 2 minutes and assess for adequate sedation for intubation. If patient adequately
                sedated, proceed with intubation as outlined in the Intubation – Endotracheal Procedure Guideline. \n\n

                attempts to pass endotracheal tube through the vocal cords. \n\n
                \t\t 7.	During intubation attempts, monitor for signs of hypoxia (significant decrease in HR,
                SpO2 levels below 90\%%, signs of ventricular ectopy, etc.). If hypoxia develops, stop all
                procedures and immediately ventilate the patient with 100\%% oxygen. \n\n
                \t\t 8.	Following intubation, confirm proper tube placement by auscultating the gastric area
                and the lungs bilaterally. Attach the EtCO2 Filter Line hub to the endotracheal tube hub.
                Ventilate the patient with a BVM and watch for appropriate capnographic waveforms with each BVM
                ventilation. Record a monitor strip as capnographic verification of appropriate endotracheal tube
                placement. \n\n

                \t\t 10.	If unable to intubate after Etomidate, progress to Section IV: Failed Airway Procedure. \n\n
        <b>III.	Successful Airway Procedure</b> \n\n
            \t •	Continuously monitor airway status to maintain intubation, adequate ventilation and adequate
            perfusion. Continue to monitor the capnographic waveforms throughout ventilations to confirm
            appropriate tube placement. Following any movement of the intubated patient to include at transfer
            of care, record a capnographic waveform strip to determine that there has not been ET tube
            dislodgment.\n\n
            \t •	If necessary to maintain sedation post-intubation and BP > or = 100 mmHg systolic, administer
            Midazolam in 2-mg increments IVP every 3-5 minutes (maximum total dosage is 10 mg). Diazepam may
            be substituted for Midazolam in 5 mg increments Slow IVP every 3-5 minutes (maximum total dosage
            is 20 mg).\n\n
            \t <b>•	If the need arises for additional post intubation sedation administer Fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg
            as a loading dose followed by a Fentanyl drip at 2 mcg/min may be used for post intubation
            sedation refractory to Midazolam.</b>\n\n
        <b>IV.	Failed Airway Procedure</b> \n\n
            \t •	Revert to Basic Life Support airway procedures as described in Section II: General
            Procedure, ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation with 100\%% oxygen. \n
            \t •	Keep the airway clear of secretions, blood and vomitus. \n
            \t •	If able to effectively ventilate the patient with a BVM, consider insertion of a
            King Airway and continue ventilations (refer to the <i>King Airway Insertion Procedure Guideline</i>). \n\n
            If attempts at ventilation fail, or ventilations fail to perfuse the patient with oxygen,
            immediately perform a Cricothyrotomy (refer to the <i>Cricothyrotomy- Surgical Procedure Guideline</i>). \n

    <string name="parameter_vad">
        This Appendix applies to the management of patients who have a ventricular assist device (VAD)
        also referred to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implanted. The VAD is a mechanical pump
        used to support the heart\’s pumping function and positive blood flow on individuals who have severe
        heart failure. \n\n
        <b>INITIAL MEDICAL CARE</b> \n\n
            \t •	Perform initial assessment: vital signs, oxygen saturation, pre-treatment 12-Lead ECG,
                focused history (SAMPLE, OPQRST), and physical exam. Inquire if the patient has an old ECG. \n\n
                \t\t o	Provide OXYGEN @ 100\%% via NRB mask or assist ventilations/oxygenation as indicated. \n\n
            \t •	Listen to heart sounds. The heart sounds may be faint. \n\n
            \t <b>•	Check for a functioning VAD:</b> These devices are usually implanted below the heart
                    in the abdominal cavity area. Use a stethoscope to listen for constant humming or whirling
                    sound. This sound confirms the VAD is functioning. \n\n
                \t\t o	The nature of the VAD function provides positive constant flow (it is a centrifugal
                    pump) therefore a <b>pulse may not be palpable</b> in these patients. \n\n
            \t <b>•	Blood Pressure:</b> A manual blood pressure may not be obtainable. An automated blood
                    pressure monitoring device may provide a reading with a narrow pulse pressure. \n\n
                \t\t o	Treatment of these patients must be based on the mean arterial pressure (MAP). The normal
                    MAP should be between 60 and 90 mm/Hg. \n\n
            \t <b>•	Pulse Oximetry:</b> These readings may not be accurate due to the continuous flow provided
                    by the VAD. \n\n
                \t\t o	Monitor side capnography for ventilation and oxygenation effectiveness. \n\n
        <b>UNRESPONSIVE PATIENT</b> \n\n
            \t •	If the patient is unresponsive to stimuli: \n\n
                \t\t o	Open the airway and ventilate/oxygenate as necessary. \n\n
                \t\t o	Obtain a blood glucose level and treat per Hypoglycemia &amp; Hyperglycemia
                    Clinical Care Guideline. \n\n
            \t •	Listen for a functioning VAD by auscultating over the abdomen. \n\n
                \t\t o	If the VAD has a whirling sound it is properly functioning. \n\n
                \t\t o	<b>DO NOT PERFORM CPR!</b> \n\n
            \t 	A VAD or LVAD is surgically implanted to the left ventricle. External cardiac compressions
                may dislodge the VAD causing death. \n\n
            \t •	If the VAD is silent have the caregiver or family member check the device external pump
                controller and power supply. \n\n
                \t\t o	<b>LISTEN TO THE CAREGIVER!</b> These individuals are experts in these devices and
                    know/understand how to operate and troubleshoot the system. \n\n
                \t\t o	VAD patients are instructed to always have a backup bag with 2 charged batteries
                    and a second pump controller. \n\n
                \t\t o	Contact the VAD coordinator listed on the patient’s information card. \n\n
            \t•	If the VAD is inoperative despite troubleshooting and battery replacement, then CPR
                is indicated as per cardiac arrest parameter. \n\n

        <b>RESPONSIVE PATIENT:</b> \n\n
            \t •	Perform a subjective interview to determine chief complaint and history of present illness. \n\n
            \t •	Monitor ECG and obtain a 12 lead ECG if chest pain, ischemic symptoms, shortness of breath or
                weakness is reported. \n\n
                \t\t o	Any cardiac dysrhythmias must be treated per the appropriate practice parameter. \n\n
                \t\t o	If electrical therapy is indicated on a conscious patient, the patient may be sedated
                    (time permitting) as per parameter. \n\n
            \t•	Establish IV access and provide fluid resuscitation as indicated based on patient\’s condition
                and hydration status. \n\n
            \t•	Assess for any other concurrent medical conditions or symptoms and treat per the appropriate
                parameter. \n\n

        <b>TRANSPORT OF PATIENT:</b> \n\n
            \t <b>•	ALL VAD patients with cardiac, respiratory, neurological or infectious disease complaints
                must be transported to the VAD center.</b> \n\n
                \t\t o	Florida Hospital Orlando and UF Health Shands are the only local approved VAD centers. \n\n
                \t\t o	Contact the VAD coordinator as soon as possible and notify them of the transport. \n\n
            \t •	VAD patients presenting with minor complaints may be transported to any receiving facility
                as long as they have their backup batteries and equipment with the patient. \n\n
                \t\t o	These complaints include, but are not limited to: \n\n
            \t 	Minor sprains, strains or orthopedic injuries \n\n
            \t 	Hypoglycemia without severe signs or symptoms \n\n
            \t 	Isolated extremity lacerations \n\n
            \t •	Don’t forget the family member/caregiver! \n\n
                \t\t o	The family member/caregiver must <b>ACCOMPANY</b> the patient in the ambulance. \n\n
                \t\t o	These individuals have intimate knowledge of the patient\’s condition, the system and
                    usually have legal authority to sign on behalf of the patient. \n\n
            \t <b>•	Bring all VAD equipment, backup bags, charger and batteries with the patient!</b> \n\n

        Sepsis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening condition due to systemic infection.
        Sepsis must be recognized early and treated aggressively to prevent progression to shock and death.
        Sepsis can be identified when the following markers of the <b>Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
        (SIRS)</b> are present in a patient with suspected infection: \n\n
            \t\t •   Temperature > 38o C (100.4o F) or &lt; 36o C (96.8o F) \n
            \t\t •	Respiratory Rate > 20 breaths /min \n
            \t\t •	Heart rate > 90 beats/min \n\n
        In addition to physiologic markers of SIRS, severe sepsis may cause hypoxia and inadequate organ
        perfusion, resulting in metabolic acidosis marked by elevated blood lactate levels and decreased ETCO2
        levels (measured by capnography). \n\n

        <b>SEPSIS ALERT:</b> \n\n
        The purpose of a <b>Sepsis Alert</b> is to provide pre-arrival Emergency Department notification in order

        The following <b>GENERAL MEASURES</b> shall be applied to help promote speed and
        efficiency when rendering emergency medical care to the sick and injured. These
        measures provide general parameters for pre-hospital emergency care delivery in
        Sumter County. \n\n
            \t <b>I. Life Safety: The overall safety of EMS personnel is paramount to quality
                patient care.</b> \n\n
                \t\t A.	Vehicle Operation Safety: All crews are expected to use knowledge,
                    foresight, and judgment at all times while operating an emergency vehicle.
                    This is vital to response, care and delivery of the patient to an appropriate
                    facility. Patients should be prioritized in such a manner as to send the most
                    appropriate resource(s) in the most appropriate manner whether emergency or
                    non-emergency based upon initial dispatch information. \n\n
                \t\t B.	Scene Safety: Each scene should be properly evaluated for hazardous
                    materials, fire, violent patients, etc. The scene should be secured by
                    appropriate agencies prior to EMS arrival and before patient contact. \n
                \t\t C.	Body Substance Isolation (BSI): Proper Personal Protective Equipment
                    MUST be utilized according to Exposure Control Plan Policies.\n\n
                \t\t D.	Medical Equipment: Only medical equipment/supplies approved by the Medical
                    Director and participating organizational administration will be utilized for
                    patient care. New equipment/supplies may be field tested (with specific
                    parameters), but only after evaluation and approval by the Medical Director. \n\n
            <b>I. Incident Management</b> \n\n
                \t\t A.	Resources: Assess the need for additional support and request appropriate
                    resources as necessary. Additional resources should be requested to the scene
                    as early as possible and response mode prioritized by the on scene incident
                    commander. \n\n
                \t\t B.	Mass Casualty: The goal is to rapidly identify patient\'s injuries and
                    sort them according to their severity and need for treatment. Refer to Triage
                    System Administrative Policy for specific details. \n\n
                \t\t C.	Incident Command: A dynamic organizational structure that expands and
                    contracts as needed to manage an event. Every effort will be utilized to
                    follow the incident command structure as outlined in the Emergency Medical
                    Action Plan (EMAP). \n\n
                \t\t D.	Mutual Aid: In cases of an out of county, mutual aid response, The
                    Villages and Sumter County EMS personnel are directed to utilize The
                    Villages and Sumter County EMS Practice Parameters for all facets of
                    pre-hospital medical care. \n\n
        <b>II. Patient Care</b> \n\n
                \t\t A.	Informed consent: Attempt to always obtain informed consent prior
                    to treatment. Respect the patient\'s right to privacy and dignity. Courtesy,
                    concern and common sense will ensure the patient of the best possible care. \n\n
                \t\t B.	Rapid initial assessment: A paramedic should generally be able to decide
                    within 3 minutes after patient contact if Advanced Life Support (ALS) will be
                    needed and should be instituted simultaneously with the initial assessment. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 1.	Rapid stabilization should, in most cases, be done on scene (where
                        the patient is encountered) prior to movement from the scene to the unit. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 2.	A comprehensive exam is appropriate after the patient has been
                        stabilized. \n\n
                \t\t C.	Care level: The paramedic is ultimately responsible for all patient care
                    and will perform an assessment on all patients to determine their level of care. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 1.	Advanced Life Support (ALS): The paramedic is required to attend
                        all patients deemed ALS. As a general rule, an ALS patient is defined as
                        one who portrays signs/symptoms that fit into 1 or more of the chief
                        complaints as outlined in the PRACTICE PARAMETERS. Patients who are
                        receiving fluid through intravenous line are NOT considered BLS patients,
                        regardless of complaint, and must be tended to by a paramedic.  \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 2.	Basic Life Support (BLS): The paramedic may designate an EMT to
                        attend to BLS patients, but still remains ultimately responsible for
                        patient care. The EMT MUST document on the run report that the Paramedic,
                        stating name and credentials, initially assessed the BLS patient. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 3.	Refusal of Care and/or Transport: All patients who receive
                        treatment are to be transported by appropriate means to an appropriate
                        receiving facility for further evaluation. If the patient refuses care
                        and/or transport, refer to the <i>Refusal of Service Administrative
                        Policy.</i> \n\n
                \t\t D.	Medication dosing: All medication dosages listed are for adults, unless
                    otherwise specified. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 1.	Adult: An adult patient is one who is 8 years of age or older. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 2.	Pediatric: A pediatric patient is under 8 years of age and 70 lbs.
                         or less according to the Length-Based Tape. \n\n
                \t\t E.	Trauma: For traumatic situations, ages are defined by the State of
                    Florida Trauma Transport criteria: \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 1.	Adult: An adult patient is one who is 16 years of age or older. \n\n
                    \t\t\t\t 2.	Pediatric: A pediatric patient is one with the anatomical
                        characteristics of a person fifteen (15) years or younger. \n\n
        <b>III. Medical Control</b> \n\n
            \t\t A.	Definition: An on-line emergency room physician who is willing to accept
                responsibility for the action of EMS personnel or the Medical Director and/or
                his associates. \n\n

                        times to the maximum area and/or population. In order to be effective
                        there must be a prompt initial assessment by the 1st response agency, a
                        rapid but appropriate treatment and a smooth transfer of patient care to
                        the transport agency. This allows for the minimal scene time and the
                        return of the 1st response agency to available status.\n\n
                    \t\t 2.	There will be rare occasions when the transport paramedic will need
                        to change the initial assessment and/or treatment plan. This is in no
                        way indicates less than optimal assessment or care by the 1st responder,
                        but recognizes that signs and symptoms are dynamic and will change during
                        the course of patient care “on scene”: \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t i.	The 1st arriving responder will perform an initial assessment
                            as per existing protocols. Appropriate treatment will be initiated
                            immediately according to the <i>Clinical Care Guidelines.</i> \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t ii.	Transfer of patient care will occur as soon as practical
                            based upon patient condition. Common sense, teamwork, and professionalism
                            will be used to ensure optimal patient care. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t iii.	If there is a significant difference of opinion as to
                            proper patient care, it will be decided by on-line Medical Control
                            or the Medical Director. A review of the call may include a discussion
                            at a later date by all involved parties in order to reach a mutual
                            understanding. \n\n
                \t B.	At Destination \n\n
                    \t\t 1.	There may be difficulties in transferring patient care upon arrival at
                        area hospitals due to the extreme overcrowding, the high volume of EMS
                        calls, and the increased severity of illness of patients. It is therefore
                        imperative that all providers work together with a spirit of cooperation
                        in order that the patients receive the best possible care. \n\n
                    \t\t 2.	The following procedures will be applied to the transfer of patient care
                        at destination: \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t i.	Once on hospital property (ED, Cath Lab, ICU, etc.), the patient is
                            the responsibility of the hospital and staff whether or not official
                            patient transfer has occurred. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t ii.	Once in the hospital, the Practice Parameters no longer govern patient
                            care. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t iii.	Any medications or procedures in progress will be continued until
                            finished unless discontinued by direction of an attending hospital
                            physician. Any new or repeat medications or procedures will be done
                            under the direction of the attending hospital physician using hospital
                            supplies and medications. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t iv.	If there is a significant change (deterioration) in patient condition,
                            the hospital medical staff must be informed immediately. Please document
                            the person, title and time contacted. \n\n
                \t C.	Documentation \n\n
                \t All agencies involved in providing patient care are responsible for ensuring accurate
                    documentation. A patient care report must be written by each responding agency for
                    each patient. \n\n
                    \t\t1.	Transport Agency \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t i.	A legible copy of the patient care report for each patient must be
                            delivered to the responsible caregiver at the receiving facility or faxed
                            to the number dedicated to receiving patient care reports. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t ii.	If time does not permit completion of the entire report, an
                            abbreviated report, at a minimum, must be left at the receiving facility.
                            The full report shall be forwarded to the receiving facility once completed,
                            within 24 hours. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t iii.	An abbreviated report shall identify, in writing, the crew, the
                            patient, vital signs, chief complaint, and treatment, as well as the times the
                            observations were made or treatment was rendered. \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t iv.	A full patient care report must be completed prior to end of the
                            paramedic\'s or EMT\'s shift. \n\n
                    \t\t2.	Non-Transport Agency \n\n
                        \t\t\t\t i.	A full patient care report must be completed upon completion of the
                            call or prior to the end of the paramedic\'s or EMT\'s shift. \n\n
            No copies of patient information will be given to anyone other than the receiving facility.
                Law enforcement agencies may be provided patient demographic information if the following
                circumstances are present: \n\n
                \t\t •	To report PHI to a law enforcement official reasonably able to prevent or lessen a
                    serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of an individual or the public
                    (i.e. to alert the LEO of possible communicable disease from a patient they have
                    contacted). \n\n
                \t\t •	To alert law enforcement to the death of the individual, when there is a suspicion
                    that death resulted from criminal conduct.\n\n
                \t\t •	To report PHI to law enforcement when required by law to do so (such as reporting
                    gunshots or stab wounds).\n\n
            Any other requests for information should be handled according to the individual agency\’s
                standard operating procedures.\n\n

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        information related to crime scene preservation. They do not comprehensively cover all
        possible situations. Sound judgment should be exercised when there is no clear direction. \n\n
        \t I.	Confirm that the scene is secure. If there is suspicion that the scene is unsafe
            upon arrival, do not enter the scene. Establish a standby zone a few blocks from the scene
            and wait for law enforcement to arrive to establish a safe scene. Then respond into the
            scene. \n\n
        \t II.	Be conscious of the surroundings. This pertains to the initial arrival of your unit
            to include but not limited to: \n\n
            \t\t\t ·	Vehicles and Bystanders on the scene \n\n

        \t V.	Establish one entry point into the scene so that the possibility of disruption of
            the crime scene is kept to a minimum. \n\n
        \t VI.	Note location of furniture, weapons and other objects. If at all possible, do not
            move items. If something has to be moved this will need to be documented and reported
            to the lead law enforcement official in charge of the scene. \n\n

    During each transport, the DNRO form shall accompany the patient. A DNRO may be revoked at
        any time. The revocation may be in writing, by physical destruction, by failure to present
        the DNRO form or by orally expressing a contrary intent. The DNRO may be revoked by: \n\n
            \t\t \t\t ·	The patient (if signed by the patient) \n\n
            \t\t \t\t ·	The patient\'s healthcare surrogate \n\n
            \t\t \t\t ·	The patient\'s proxy, court-appointed guardian, or Power of Attorney \n\n
    <b><i>Even with a DNRO form, the patient shall be provided comfort, pain relief, or any other
        medically indicated care (i.e. oxygen administration, CPAP, etc.) short of respiratory or
        cardiac resuscitation.</i></b> \n\n
    In situations where the patient is found to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and end of life has
        been determined, it may be appropriate for the paramedic to take NO ACTION. This may apply
        when the patient has a valid DNRO and is under the care of Hospice, even though Hospice
        personnel may not be on scene. In this situation the paramedic and EMT may assist the family
        in contacting the patient\'s physician and/or Hospice, as well as a funeral home. In
        such a case, it is not necessary for responding EMS/fire department personnel to contact
        law enforcement, unless there are questions regarding the end of life. \n\n
    <b>Document the original body position and location.</b> Disposable supplies
        (i.e., EKG electrodes) will be left in place. Contact Law Enforcement regarding patient
        body care and removal except in above-stated situation. \n\n

    In cases involving the indication of necessary fluid therapy, and/or the clinical care guidelines
        that require fluid infusion the following will be considered: \n\n
        \t\t •	All IVs should start out with an NS Lock initially. \n\n
        \t\t •	Indications of a preventative nature should be treated with an IV lock of NS, and
            patient condition monitored for signs of hypotension and/or hypovolemia. If the patient\’s
            condition requires an infusion then proceed as indicated. Otherwise, preparing a bag “just
            in case” should be avoided, and IV solutions reserved for the patient of <b><u>critical</u></b>
            need only. \n\n
        \t\t •	Guidelines that require medication administration also require a NS flush after
            the administration. This should be accomplished with prefilled 10cc NS syringes,
            as there is no shortage of that resource. \n\n
        \t\t •	Fluid therapy that is of a non-critical nature, and can be accomplished at the
            receiving emergency room, should be withheld for the sake of the critical need. \n\n
        \t\t •	<b>At no time will fluid therapy be withheld if the general impression of the patient is
        that of any etiology that suggests any form of shock, and the patient presents with the
        signs and symptoms of hypo-perfusion.</b> \n\n
    The general initiative of this guideline during times of medication or product shortage needs
        to be that of preservation for the patients of critical need. Normal saline that can be
        given in lower quantities from smaller bags or syringes should be administered first,
        saving the large 500ml and 1000ml quantities for patients who require those larger more
        rapid infusions. \n\n
    In absence of Sodium Chloride 0.9\%% (Normal Saline), Lactated Ringers can be used as an
        alternative IV solution. Dextrose 5\%% will still be used for medication infusions, and
        should only be used for volume replacement as a last resort and only in the absence of
        normal saline or lactated ringers. \n\n
    In times of shortages, some logistical reallocations of remaining fluids may be necessary,
        therefore deviations from typical required par levels on ALS units will also be necessary
        and otherwise temporarily authorized. \n\n

    <string name="title_activity_physician_on_scene">Physician On Scene</string>
    <string name="physician_on_scene_header"><b><i>PHYSICIAN ON SCENE</i></b></string>
    <string name="physician_on_scene_param">
        Medical control of the scene of an emergency is the responsibility of the individual in
            attendance who is the most appropriately trained in providing pre-hospital stabilization
            and transport. As an agent of the Medical Director of an EMS system, the Paramedic represents
            that individual. \n\n
        Occasions will arise when a physician on the scene will desire to direct pre-hospital care.
            A standardized plan for dealing with these contingencies will optimize the care given to the
            patient. \n\n
        I.	<b>Physician On-Scene <i>(within office)</i></b> \n\n
            \t\t A.	When EMS is called to a physician\'s office, the paramedic should receive
                information from the physician in an attempt to provide the service requested by the
                physician. \n\n
            \t\t B.	While in the physician\'s office, the physician shall remain in charge of the
                patient. The paramedic may follow the direction of the physician as long as it is
                within the scope of the Practice Parameters. Anytime there is a conflict between a
                physician\'s order and the protocols, Medical Control shall be contacted. \n\n
            \t\t C.	Once the patient is in the ambulance, unless the physician accompanies the patient,
                the paramedic shall follow the Practice Parameters. \n\n
        II.	<b>Physician On-Scene <i>(outside office)</i></b> \n\n
            \t\t A.	The physician desiring to assume care of the patient must provide documentation
                of his/her status as a physician (M.D. or D.O.) \n\n
            \t\t B.	Contact with Medical Control at the receiving facility must be established as
                soon as possible. The physician assuming responsibility at the scene should be
                placed in contact with the Medical Control Physician and acknowledgment of his or her
                acceptance of responsibility confirmed. \n\n
            \t\t C.	Orders provided by the physician assuming responsibility for the patient should
                be followed as long as they do not, in the judgment of the paramedic, endanger patient
                well-being. The paramedic may request the physician to attend the patient during
                transport if the suggested treatment varies significantly from the Practice
                Parameters. \n\n
            \t\t D.	If the physician\'s care is judged by the paramedic to be potentially harmful to
                the patient, the paramedic should: \n\n
                \t\t \t\t 1.	Politely voice his or her objections. \n\n
                \t\t \t\t 2.	IMMEDIATELY place the physician on the scene in contact with Medical
                    Control for resolution of the problem. \n\n
                \t\t \t\t 3.	When conflicts arise between the physician on the scene and Medical
                    Control, EMS personnel should follow the directives of the Medical Control
                    Physician. Offer no assistance in carrying out the order in question, but provide
                    no resistance to the physician performing this care. If the physician on scene
                    continues to carry out the order in question, offer no assistance and enlist aid
                    from law enforcement. \n\n
                \t\t \t\t 4.	Ultimately, Medical Control Physician’s orders shall prevail. \n\n
        Note: Interactions with physicians on the scene must be completely documented in the patient
            care report. However, disputes shall not appear on the patient care report. Separate
            written documentation shall be completed and forwarded through the chain of command. \n\n
